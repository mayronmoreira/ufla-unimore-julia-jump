    "Moe is deciding how many Regular Duffs and Special Duffs he needs to deliver in each week. The Regular Duff costs to Moe \\\\$1 for each bottle, and he sells it by \\\\$2. Special Duff costs \\\\$1.5 for each bottle, and he sells it by \\\\$3. However, as part of a controversial marketing strategy, the Duff company only sells one Special Duff bottle for at least two bottles of Regular Duff that Moe buys. Moreover, due to some problems happened some years ago, Duff will not sell to Moe more than 3.000 bottles by week. According to his experience, Moe knows that he can sell all the beers that we can buy. Now, it is your turn: **implement a mathematical model** using Julia and JuMP, that helps Moe to decide how many Regular Duffs and Special Duffs he must buy to optimize his profit."

    "[Pokemon Go](https://www.pokemongo.com/it-it/) is a game developed by [Niantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) which consists of collecting items (or Pokemons) by players through specific placed called Pokestops. Suppose that we have the following Pokestops, represented by their coordinates below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to model this problem is to use the *One-Commodity Formulation*. Let´s implement it! For this purpose, let $x_{ij}$ be a binary variable equal to 1 if we travel by arc $(i,j)$ in the Hamiltonian cycle. We define $f_{ij} \\ge 0$ as the flow in the arc $(i,j)$. Then, the model reads.\n",
