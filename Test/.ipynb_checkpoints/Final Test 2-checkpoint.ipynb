    "Moe is deciding how many Regular Duffs and Special Duffs he needs to deliver in each week. The Regular Duff costs to Moe \\\\$1 for each bottle, and he sells it by \\\\$2. Special Duff costs \\\\$1.5 for each bottle, and he sells it by \\\\$3. However, as part of a controversial marketing strategy, the Duff company only sells one Special Duff bottle for at least two bottles of Regular Duff that Moe buys. Moreover, due to some problems happened some years ago, Duff will not sell to MOe more than 3.000 bottles by week. According to his experience, Moe knows that he can sell all the beers that we can buy. Now, it is your turn: **implement a mathematical model** using Julia and JuMP, that helps Moe to decide how many Regular Duffs and Special Duffs he must buy to optimize his profit."

Write a Julia + JuMP code that maximizes: the sum of the values corresponding to the selected items, subtracted from the cost of the second knapsack, if it is used.\n",
