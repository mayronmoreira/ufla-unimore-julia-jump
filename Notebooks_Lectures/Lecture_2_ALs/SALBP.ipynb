    "Assembly lines are standard manufacturing systems present in large-scale production. Given a scenario of labour high costs, industries try to implement efficient procedures to plan their activities in order to be competitive against developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line balancing is a classical combinatorial optimization problem introduced by Salveson (1955). We focus on its most studied variant: the *Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem* (SALBP). We consider a set of tasks $N=\\{1,...,n\\}$, and an ordered set of stations $S=\\{1,...,m\\}$, $n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Each task $i \\in N$ has an execution time defined by $p_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_+$. Let $s(i) \\in S$ be a station where task $i$ is assigned. We model technological characteristics of the line by precedence constraints between tasks such that $i \\preceq j$ ($i$ immediate precedes $j$) means that $s(i) \\le s(j)$. Consider $P_i \\subseteq N$ as a set of immediate predecessors of task $i$ and $F_i \\subseteq N$ as a set of immediate followers of task $i$. We define $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_+$ as the cycle time of the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The feasibility version of the problem, called SALBP-F, consists in answering the following question: **\"Is there a task assignment to stations that respects precedence and cycle time constraints, given a pre-defined number of stations $m$ and a cycle time $c$?\"**. The SALBP-F is a NP-Hard problem, since it reduces to a *Partitioning Problem* (Scholl, 1999; Wee & Magazine, 1982). Figure shown below (Moreira, 2015) illustrates the SALBP-F through an example with $c=8$ and $m=5$.\n",

The SALBP-1 appears in situations where we can have a good estimate of the demand, allowing a fixation of cycle time *a priori* and minimizing installation costs by means of number of stations. As follows, we present a feasible solution for this problem (Moreira, 2015), using the previous instance with $\\overline{c}=9$ and $m=4$.\n",

    "The *Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem type 2* (SALBP-2) minimizes the cycle time, given a number of stations $m$. The SALBP-2 appears in situations where we have already the line installed and we want to increase the efficiency of the production. As follows, we present a feasible solution for this problem (Moreira, 2015), using the previous instance with $c=18$ and $m=3$.\n",
