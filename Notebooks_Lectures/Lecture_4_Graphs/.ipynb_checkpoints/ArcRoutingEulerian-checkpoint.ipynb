    " \n",
    "Consider a company that wants to plan routing activities in a city, for commercial proposals. The company aims at dividing streets into connected districts to avoid overloading of its teams. The number of business areas corresponds to the number of depots the company has. The main goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by workers assigned to its corresponding region, using the depot position as a reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will work with García-Ayala et al. (2016) paper, that describes a variant of the previous arc routing problem such that the induced subgraph generated by the partitioning process must keep even degree of their vertices, keeping a percentage of Eulerian subgraphs. The idea of having Eulerian subgraphs is to avoid running the same edge twice and then, reduce \"*deadhead time*.\" As follows, we show the **Figure extracted from García-Ayala et al. (2016)**, that shows unfavorable and favorable arc partitions.\n",
