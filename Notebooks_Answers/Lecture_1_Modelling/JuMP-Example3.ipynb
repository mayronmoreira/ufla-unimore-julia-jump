    "Consider a company that manufactures $n$ products and wants to schedule its production over the next $T$ periods. Each product has a specific demand in each period, which must be exactly met. The costs of production (stock) depend on the quantity produced (stored) and vary according to the item and period. The production of a particular item consumes a certain amount of resource (e.g., water, energy, gas) pre-determined for the period in question. Given this scenario, this enterprise wants to plan the production control of the products in each period, aiming at minimizing production costs and inventory costs."
